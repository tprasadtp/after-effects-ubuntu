# Debugging the script

You can chose from multiple debug modes. by setting DEBUG variable to one of the following

- `DEBUG=1` Print debug messages
- `DEBUG=internal` display some internal debug messages
- `DEBUG=trace` Print debug, internal and also apt logs.
This can generate a lot of output.

## Local testing

You can use `./tests/test-distro.sh` to test the scripts locally. It uses docker to build and test the script in simulate mode inside
containers. This script requires two arguments __distro name__ and __release node name__. They are used as parameters to build the Docker image from dockerfile in `dockerfiles/tests`.eg.to test the script on Ubuntu 18.04 bionic, run it as
`./tests/test-distro.sh ubuntu bionic`. It will fetch and build the docker image and run the script in simulate mode using the config files at `https://{branch-name}--ubuntu-post-insta..netlify.net/config/default.yml`

Alternatively you can build the docker image yourself. and test it.

```console
$ export distro="ubuntu"
$ export release="bionic"
$ docker build -t ae:"${distro}-${release}" \
    --build-arg DISTRO="${distro}" \
    --build-arg CODE_NAME="${release}"  \
    ./dockerfiles/tests
$ docker run -it -v $(pwd)/after-effects:/shared/after-effects:ro \
    -v $(pwd)/config/:/shared/config:ro \
    ae:ubuntu-bionic

!!! tip
    This assumes that you can run docker without using sudo. Add yourself yo docker group or refer to docker documentation
    for more info.
