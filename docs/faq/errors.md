# Errors

## What if I get an error saying Unknown Distribution/Release?

That usually means you are running a Distribution which is not supported or too old or a derivative which is not recognized by the script. However it also might be possible that `lsb-release` package is missing from your system. Since the script depends on it for determining what is the code-name of the release it will fail.
You might see ans error like this,

``` log
./after-effects: line 41: lsb_release: command not found
./after-effects: line 42: lsb_release: command not found
./after-effects: line 43: lsb_release: command not found
./after-effects: line 44: lsb_release: command not found

```

- It means that you do not have _lsb-release_ package installed. It happens usually on docker containers. See [What are its dependencies? What do I need on my system to run this?](#what-are-its-dependencies-what-do-i-need-on-my-system-to-run-this)
- Install `lsb-release` package using `apt-get -y install lsb-release`
- In the case above you are probably missing other dependencies as well. It might be a good idea to install those dependencies first.
