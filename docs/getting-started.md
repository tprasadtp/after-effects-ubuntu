# How to use?

## Install Ubuntu

Install (if you haven't already) your choice of Ubuntu/Derivative as you would( If you wish to automate that too, you can use preseed.cfg file)

## Step 1: Get the script

#### Without Git

Run this in Terminal

```console
wget -Nnv https://ae.prasadt.com/get -O - | bash
```

> URL redirects to file with last known good commit on GitHub. It is cached & proxies to GitHub at CDN level. If you are paranoid, use git.
If you wish to use master branch pass `--master` or `-m` as an argument. Eg: `wget -Nnv https://ae.prasadt.com/get -O - | bash -s --master`

#### With Git

If you already have git on your system, you can use,

```console
git clone https://github.com/tprasadtp/ubuntu-post-install.git && cd ubuntu-post-install
```

If you already have cloned the repo, you can use `git pull` to get the latest changes.

> This will use master branch which may not be as stable as versioned releases.

## Step 2: Update the lists or config.yml to suit your needs

Update the list or config files to suit your needs. Change PPAs, add or delete packages to list, tweak variables etc.
Please see [Configuration](https://ae.prasadt.com/config/#package-lists) & [Tasks](https://ae.prasadt.com/tasks/#what-can-it-do) for more details. Some example configs can be found [here](https://github.com/tprasadtp/ubuntu-post-install/tree/master/config).

## Step 3: Run it

Run the script as **root**. You will get an error if you do not run the script as root.

!!! tip
    Before you run the script, make sure that its executable.

```console
  sudo ./after-effects -C <your config.yml>
```

To use lists

```console
sudo ./after-effects -L
```

???+ warning "Note for using this script inside docker containers"

    - If you are running this in a docker container, you probably are root.
    - Its possible that you might be missing `sudo` package. So In that case just run it as `./after-effects`. Be warned! You probably are missing several dependencies of the script!
