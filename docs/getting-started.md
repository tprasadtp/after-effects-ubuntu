# How to use?

## Install Ubuntu
Install (if you haven't already) your choice of Ubuntu/Derivative as you would( If you wish to automate that too, you can use preseed.cfg file)

## Step 1: Get the script

#### Without Git

Run this in Terminal

```sh
wget -Nnv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tprasadtp/ubuntu-post-install/master/get-after-effects.sh -O - | bash
```

Or if you want to use remote configuration & not download or use .list files

```sh
wget -Nnv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tprasadtp/ubuntu-post-install/master/get-after-effects.sh -O - | bash -s -- -r
```

#### With Git

If you already have git on your system already you can use,

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/tprasadtp/ubuntu-post-install.git && cd ubuntu-post-install
```

## Step 2: Update the lists to suit your needs (Optional)

Update the list files to suit your needs. Change PPAs, add or delete packages to list, tweak variables etc.
Please see [Configuration](https://ae.prasadt.com/config/#package-lists) & [Tasks](https://ae.prasadt.com/tasks/#what-can-it-do) for more details.

## Step 3: Run it

Run the script as **root**. You will get an error if you do not run the script as root.

!!! tip
    Before you run the script, make sure that its executable.

```sh
sudo ./after-effects
```

???+ warning "Note for using this script inside docker containers"
    - If you are running this in a docker container, you probably are root.
    - Its possible that you might be missing `sudo` package. So In that case just run it as `./after-effects`. Be warned! You probably are missing several dependencies of the script!
