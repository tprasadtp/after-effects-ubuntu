# Proposed Changes

## APT config for adding generic apt repos

Not yet in stable. There is no plan to remove

- Google Chrome
- ROS
- VSCode
- Docker
- Spotify
- Skype
- Google Cloud

from apt-repo configs. they will be supported with single entry config via `add_repo.<id>`.
However following may be removed in the future versions as they are not supported properly
by their vendors and often require some tweaks or for other reasons. You can add them via new
`apt_sources` config if you want.

- InSync
- Duo Security
- GCSFUSE(hasen't been updated since bionic)
