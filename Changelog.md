## _v3.0_

- ### Confirmation dialogs
  - Add Confirmation dialog using whiptail for Actions like Adding PPA, Repositories, Installing Apps, and Deb files
  - Provide an option via command line to bypass the confirmation dialog for ci and automated environments or when its too annoying

- ### Improvements to Simulate option
  - If the simulate option is selected then Only calculate the upgrade but do not perform upgrade.
  - Added improved Simulate options. Helpful when just want to change somethings and test scripts without really downloading and installing packages
  - Simulate option is by default false and can be toggled by passing `-s` or `--simulate` while running the script via command line
- ### Partner repositories and Derivatives
  - Do not Enable Canonical Partner repositories in Ubuntu derivatives as they are enabled in installer or are different than Ubuntu. This leaves Partner repositories as they were before
- ### Add Feature: Purge Unwanted Packages
  - Fix a bug in PPA purge function where it would wait for user confirmation
  - Add a feature to purge not required packages, usually games and boaltware which comes preloaded  with the install. It is necessary to pass a flag `-d` via command line to purge them while running the script since its dangerous
- ### Logs & Console messages
  - Improved logging . Redirecting errors and adding time-stamps works better.
- ### Travis CI and Docker Testing
  - Added Dockerfiles used for test cases since base Ubuntu image does not have few necessary packages (`ping, wget, lsb-release, whiptail, iputils-ping`) and configuration required. Since most of these are bound to present on Ubuntu/Ubuntu Server/ Ubuntu derivatives it is not necessary to add them in the script.
  - Added Docker and Travis CI detection . Now the logs will indicate if the script is running in Container or Travis CI
  - Test Script on Travis CI in parallel using jobs.
  - Test Script on Trusty using Travis Host
  - Test Script on Xenial, Artful and Zesty using Docker image build using Dockerfiles.

  - Improved exit status handling
