## URLs

```bash
Github URL: https://github.com/tprasadtp/ubuntu-post-install
Github URL: https://github.com/tprasadtp/after-effects-ubuntu
```

## How to use this?

Install your choice of Ubuntu/Debian or its derivative as you would( If you wish to automate that too, you can use `preseed.cfg file`)

### Step 1: Get the script

#### Without Git

Run this in Terminal

```sh
wget -Nnv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tprasadtp/ubuntu-post-install/master/get-after-effects.sh -O - | bash
```

Or if you want to use YAML configuration & not download or use .list files

```sh
wget -Nnv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tprasadtp/ubuntu-post-install/master/get-after-effects.sh -O - | bash -s -- -r
```

#### With Git

If you already have git on your system already you can use,

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/tprasadtp/ubuntu-post-install.git && cd ubuntu-post-install
```

If you already have cloned the repo, you can use git to get the latest changes.

### Step 2: Update the lists or your YAML configuration file

Update the list files or YAML file to suit your needs. Change PPAs, add or delete packages to list, tweak flags etc.
Please see [Configuration](https://ae.prasadt.com/config/#package-lists) & [Tasks](https://ae.prasadt.com/tasks/#what-can-it-do).

### Step 3: Run the script

Run the script as **root**. You will get an error if you do not run the script as root.

```sh
sudo ./after-effects
```

> If you are running this in a docker container, you probably are root and its possible that you might be missing `sudo`. So In that case just run it as `./after-effects`. Be warned! You might be missing several dependencies of the script!!

### Step 4: Contribute!

Contribute tweaks, improvements ideas back upstream.
Please note that `gh-pages` branch is complete derivative of master. Please checks docs directory for documentation. This project uses `mkdocs` for documentation. You can use docker-compose to test documentation site.
